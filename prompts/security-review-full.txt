You are performing a scheduled security audit for the Docker MCP Registry.
Review every server described in full-audit-summary.md. Each server has its repository checkout in `/tmp/full-audit/<server>/repo` with
metadata captured in the summary file.

Focus on supply-chain and security risks such as credential exfiltration, unauthorized network activity, privilege escalation, or
persistence mechanisms.

Produce a Markdown report using the template in templates/security-review-full.md.
Critical instructions:
- Write the report to `/tmp/security-review.md` only.
